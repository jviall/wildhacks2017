## What it does:

  * Converts speech to text using a javascript Speech Recognition API. Then, using the compromise natural language processing (NLP) API, parse meaning from the recorded words. Finally, it places the words we had in our image library onto the webpage, creating a scene. Next to the sence, the words previously recorded scroll by in real time. 

## How to run:

  * On the CL type: "npm install" then "npm start"

## How to use: 

  * On the webpage, click start recording then read the following script to it: 
  > Your party arrives at a clearing in the lush green forest. In plain sight is a pile of loot. Among it, you see a treasure chest, and a dwarvish mace. 
Nearby sits a golden mask and a blue potion. You're all a bit skeptical that so many great items are lying here for the taking. The party is slightly uneasy at the presence of a skull. 
Despite this, you can't resist the temptation. You approach the pile, but just before you reach it, a magical fairy appears, confronting you. It looks to be awaiting your next move...
